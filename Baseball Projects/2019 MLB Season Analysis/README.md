## Goal
### The goal of this project was to use data science techniques to analyze the hitters in the 2019 MLB Season. Specifically I wanted to explore the following: 
  * ### What Positional Groups Have the Best Plate Approach? 
    * #### Based on total bases and walk to strikeout ratio
    * #### Using a Gaussian Mixture clustering model
  * ### Can we Predict a Player's Division They Play In?
    * #### Based on their offensive performance
    * #### Using decision trees
  * ### What Variables Best Explain the Variance in OPS+ Scores? 
    * #### Using PCA analysis
