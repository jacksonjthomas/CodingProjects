## Goal
### The goal of this project was to evaluate hitter performance based on measurements of batted ball metrics. Specifically I need to project the "true" average exit velocity for each batter by using two differnt measurement systems of batted ball data. 
  * ### Variables
    * ### SpeedOffBat
      * ### Exit Velocity  
    * ### VeritcalAngle
      * ### Launch Angle
